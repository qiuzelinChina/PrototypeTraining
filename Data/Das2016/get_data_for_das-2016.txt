1. Download the original data [1] into this fold. The downloaded files in this fold should contains: S*.mat, stimuli.zip
2. Unzip stimuli.zip 
3. Run preprocess_data_raw.mat and you will obtain a folder named "preprocessed", which contains the extracted EEG and corresponding label (./preprocessed/S*_raw.mat).
4. Run add_wavelet.m to conduct filtering, re-reference and wavelet transform. The output file named "S*_preprocessed.m" are stored in the preprocessed folder (./preprocessed/S*_preprocessed.mat).
5. Run get_data_python.py to convert data format. The output file named "S*_preprocessed_py.mat" are stored in the preprocessed folder (./preprocessed/S*_preprocessed_py.mat).

Note:
1. The preprocess_data_raw.m is modified from /src/examples/preprocess_data.m in https://zenodo.org/records/3997352#.YxMIBNNBz_V.
1. For direction classification, the label 0 and 1 represent left and right, respectively.
